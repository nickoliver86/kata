# Roman Numeral Kata

The Romans wrote their numbers using letters; specifically the letters:

- I = 1
- V = 5
- X = 10
- L = 50
- C = 100
- D = 500
- M = 1000 

There were certain rules that the numerals followed which should be observed:
- The symbols 'I', 'X', 'C', and 'M' can be repeated at most 3 times in a row. 
- The symbols 'V', 'L', and 'D' can never be repeated. 
- The '1' symbols ('I', 'X', and 'C') can only be subtracted from the 2 next highest values ('IV' and 'IX', 'XL' and 'XC', 'CD' and 'CM'). 
-Only one subtraction can be made per numeral ('XC' is allowed, 'XXC' is not). The '5' symbols ('V', 'L', and 'D') can never be subtracted.

Examples:
- 1 = I
- 9 = IX
- 2017 = MMXVII

#### Write a program that converts a number to a Roman Numeral.  I've added the first test for you.

### The rules.

- Everyone takes a turn
  - Turn 1 - Write a test
  - Turn 2 - Make the test work
  - Turn 3 - Write a test
  and so on
  
 - If you finish early, do it in reverse.  Enter a roman numeral and get a number back.
  
 - No cheating.
